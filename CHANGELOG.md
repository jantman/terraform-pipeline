# v4.0
* [Issue #120](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/120) Delay when plugins are applied
    * This is a change in the plugin behavior.  Plugins will now affect TerraformCommands even after they've been instantiated - this was not previously the case.
    * The purpose of this, is to allow other Plugins to modify Environment variables.  Some TerraformCommands may be affected by the Environment variables at the time in which plugins are applied (eg: S3BackendPlugin).  Make sure that all possible environment variables are available at the time in which plugins are applied to the commands.

    * Support upper or lower case environment prefixes
    * Support general, or environment-specific configuration

    * ACTION: *Deprecated* DEFAULT_S3_BACKEND_REGION - use S3_BACKEND_REGION, env_S3_BACKEND_REGION, AWS_REGION, or AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
    * ACTION: *Deprecated* env_S3_BACKEND_DYNAMO_TABLE_LOCK - use S3_BACKEND_DYNAMODB_TABLE, or env_S3_BACKEND_DYNAMODB_TABLE

* [Issue #76](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/76) The README shows an example of providing a local Customizations class.  That doesn't actually work.  Remove that from the README until we can find something that works.

# v3.4
* [Issue #49](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/49) Allow Consul address to be provided in ways other than hard-coding.
* [Issue #50](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/50) Allow Consul path pattern for environments to be overridden.

# v2.4
* Bug fix: Prefer Jenkinsfile.defaultNodeName over environment variable DEFAULT_NODE_NAME when choosing the node to run jobs
* ParameterStoreBuildWrapperPlugin now available, and is the preferred method to retrieve ParameterStore parameters.  Start deprecating use of ParameterStoreExecPlugin.

# v2.3.1
* Optionally stash and unstash an artifact generated by the BuildStage.  See Issue #40 (https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/40)
* Delete and checkout SCM only once, at the beginning of every TerraformEnvironmentStage

# v2.3
* Add a BuildStage.groovy that can be used to insert an arbitrary build script in your pipeline.

# v2.2.1
* Fix typo in README for ParameterStoreExecPlugin.  Example code did not work if you copy-paste.

# v2.2
* Update README with clarifications on Plugin use.
* Add missing AwssumePlugin to README

# v2.1
* Update README with strategies for DRY'ing up plugin configuration.

# v2.0
* [Issue #10](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/10) - flesh out a general pattern for plugins.  These are breaking changes.
* AnsiColorPlugin is no longer active by default.  Enable AnsiColorPlugin by calling `AnsiColorPlugin.init()`
* CrqPlugin is no longer active by default.  Enable CrqPlugin by calling `CrqPlugin.init()`
* Combine and rename ParameterStorePlugin to ParameterStoreExecPlugin.
* ParameterStoreExecPlugin is no longer active by default.  Enable ParameterExecStorePlugin by calling `ParameterStoreExecPlugin.init()`
* New TerraformEnvironmentStagePlugin interface - AnsiColorPlugin and CrqPlugin implements this.  Plugins should implement this type of interface going forward.
* StageConditionPlugin is now implemented as a TerraformEnvironmentStagePlugin.  It continues to be enabled by default, and continues to default to the master branch.
* Rename StageConditionPlugin to ConditionalApplyPlugin.
* TerraformConfirmPlugin is now implemented as a TerraformEnvironmentStagePlugin.  It continues to be enabled by default, with all existing defaults.
* Rename TerraformConfirmPlugin to ConfirmApplyPlugin

# v1.7
* [Issue #16](https://github.com/manheim/terraform-pipeline/issues/16): support either HTTPS or SSH urls when constructing repo slug (used for consul state path on terraform plan and terraform apply)
* Add gradle and unit testing

# v1.6
* awssume is no longer used by default in terraform-plan and terraform-apply
* A new AwssumePlugin is available, which will add awssume functionality if you want it

# v1.5
* parameter-store-exec is no longer used by default in terraform-plan, terraform-apply
* A new ParameterStoreExec Plugin is available, which will restore that functionality if you want it.
* Reduce boiler plate code for Jenkinsfile - a new init() method takes in the Script, the environment, and an optional customization class (just needs an init()) method, where you can load any plugins that might customize the behavior of your pipeline (eg: ParameterStoreExec)

# v1.3
* Store the `env` variable for later use
* Allow pipeline users to provide a DEFAULT_NODE_NAME environment variable, rather than explicitly specifying it in the pipeline
